The Infinite Salmon is a blog dedicated to the topic of careers in science, including doing a PhD, completing a dissertation, and making sense of this weird life and lifestyle people in science tend to choose for themselves.  The Infinite Salmon is run by a principal investigator, scientist, former professor, and sometimes academic-skeptic.  Their Ph.D. is in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

There are aspects about life as an academic and a scientist which are unpleasant and often considered taboo.  We don't do a good enough job in our community of letting people know the costs associated with our professions, the pathways available to them, or the priorities and boundaries they are entitled to have -- even when their thesis or tenure committees disagree.  In this blog I share advice that I've found helps me balance life and work, achieve happiness, while still being successful in my field.
